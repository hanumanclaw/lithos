# Lithos

**Shared memory for AI agents.**

A local, privacy-first knowledge base that enables heterogeneous AI agents to share knowledge and coordinate work.

## The Problem

Enterprise AI adoption is stalling at the infrastructure layer. According to a [Computer Weekly / IDC survey](https://www.computerweekly.com/), **only 2% of enterprises have deployed AI at scale** — despite a potential **$450B market opportunity**. A [2025 NBER study of 6,000 executives](https://www.nber.org/) found that the primary barrier is the absence of reliable, shared knowledge infrastructure.

When agents cannot share what they know, every agent starts from zero. Work is duplicated, discoveries are lost, and coordination breaks down. Lithos solves this by providing a **persistent, shared knowledge layer** that compounds in value over time.

## What It Is

Lithos is an MCP server that provides a shared knowledge store for AI agents running on your local infrastructure. Knowledge is stored as human-readable Markdown files (compatible with Obsidian) while providing fast full-text and semantic search for agents.

## Who It's For

Lithos is the **Knowledge Layer** for teams running AI agents in production.

Just as Alation coined the term "Knowledge Layer" for enterprise data governance, Lithos provides the equivalent for AI agent systems: a structured, searchable, shared memory that **compounds in value** the more it is used. Each agent interaction enriches the knowledge base, making every subsequent agent smarter and faster.

- Teams running multiple AI agents (Agent Zero, OpenClaw, Claude Code, custom agents)
- Developers who want agents to share discoveries and avoid duplicate work
- Anyone who needs agent knowledge to be inspectable and version-controlled

## Key Features

- **📁 Markdown-first**: All knowledge stored as Obsidian-compatible `.md` files
- **🔍 Fast search**: Tantivy full-text + ChromaDB semantic search
- **🕸️ Knowledge graph**: NetworkX-powered relationships via `[[wiki-links]]`
- **🤝 Multi-agent coordination**: Task claiming, findings sharing, status tracking
- **🧠 Research cache**: One-call freshness check so agents skip redundant research — returns hit/miss/stale with update guidance
- **🔗 URL deduplication**: Automatic detection and prevention of duplicate notes from the same source URL
- **🧬 Provenance tracking**: Declare which notes a synthesis is derived from and query lineage across the knowledge base
- **🔌 MCP interface**: Works with any MCP-compatible agent or tool
- **🏠 Local & private**: No cloud dependencies, you own your data

## Quickstart

### Agent Zero

Agent Zero running inside docker on the same machine running lithos

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lithos": {
      "url": "http://host.docker.internal:8765/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenClaw

Update `mcporter.json` Probably in `~/.openclaw/workspace/config/mcporter.json`

Use `localhost` if running on the same machine as OpenClaw, otherwise the name or IP address of the server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lithos": {
      "baseUrl": "http://<your hostname>:8765/sse"
    }
  },
  "imports": []
}
```

### Claude code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse lithos http://localhost:8765/sse
```
