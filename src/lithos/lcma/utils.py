def merge_and_normalize(candidates: list[Candidate]) -> list[Candidate]:
    """Merge candidates by node_id and normalise scores to ``[0, 1]``.

    Implements per-scout min-max normalisation followed by a merge step
    that deduplicates by ``node_id`` (see design doc §5.3.1).

    **Normalisation** is applied per scout:

    * Within each scout's candidate group, the highest raw score maps to
      ``1.0`` and the lowest to ``0.0``.
    * If every candidate in a scout group has the *same* raw score the span
      is zero — all candidates in that group receive a normalised score of
      ``1.0`` (i.e. the single-element case is treated as a perfect match).

    **Merge** deduplicates across scouts by ``node_id``:

    * The merged candidate keeps the *maximum* normalised score.
    * ``reasons`` lists are concatenated (order of first encounter preserved).
    * ``scouts`` lists are unioned (duplicates removed, order not guaranteed).

    The input list is **not mutated**; new ``Candidate`` objects are returned.

    Args:
        candidates: Raw candidates from one or more scouts.  May be empty.

    Returns:
        Deduplicated, normalised candidates in an unspecified order.
        The caller is responsible for any final ranking/sorting.
